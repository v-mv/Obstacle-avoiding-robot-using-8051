# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot-Using-8051
# Mohit Vaidya

# Project Description 
* The obstacle avoiding robot using 8051 is a robotic vehicle that uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in its path. The system uses an 8051 family microprocessor to achieve this functionality.

# Hardware Requirements
* 8051 Microcontroller (prefreably AT89C52)
* Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
* Motor Driver IC L293D
* Servo Motor
* 2 DC Geared BO motors

# Software Requirements
* Keil Uvision 5
* Proteus 8 (for creating simulated circuit diagram)

# Programming Language
* Embedded C

# Introduction
* The ultrasonic robot vehicle has been arranged to discover the objects in the 
particular space.
* If it finds out the object, then the vehicle will diverge from it.
* When the sensor senses the object in moving direction then it stops and checks 
if any hurdle is present in left or right direction.
* If any hurdles are present to the 
right-side direction with near space, then it diverges to hurdle free path. 
* Similarly, the self-determining hurdle avoider does if any object is present in 
left side direction.
